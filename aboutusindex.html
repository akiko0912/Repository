<h5><u>About this website</u></h5>
  <p>This website contains some recipes considered to be delicious by the creator of this website as well as associates and friends.</p>
  <p>Our aim for this website was to create a webpage which contains different recipes from around the world.</p>
  <p>We would really appreciate it if you could submit your own recipes that you don't mind us sharing on our website. Remember to tell us which country it originates from!</p>
<br></br>
<h6><u>Why and How this website was made<u></h6>
  <p>This website was created as part of our project for a 'Coding for Girls' course.</p>
  <p>This course took place at the University of Reading.</p>
  <p>We started this course without any knowledge of coding but have now created our own website after only attending the sessions for 8 weeks.</p>
  <p>This course was taught by three students at the University of Reading. They have been really helpful and friendly with explaining the step-by-step instruction on how to code. We would thoroughly recommend this course to anyone with even the slightest interest in learning how to code.</p>
